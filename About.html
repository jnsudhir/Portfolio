<p>Ever since I was a kid, computers and it's technologies has been my passion. I still remember when I first started using Ms-paint and office applications when I was a little kid.

    This passion carried me through my education in computer science where I studied C,C++,python,Computer networks,DBMS,System design,design patterns and many more. I always used to wonder where can I implement all my learnings.
    
    So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me and helped me to implement all my learnings. There's certainly yet more to learn, more problems to solve and more to build and I'm grateful for this.
    
    I am the fellow that people call to handle their most challenging issues.
